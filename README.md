# Private Social Sharing

## About
Most "Share with Twitter/Facebook/Google+" buttons leak user data even
when people don't don't use the button.

This implementation of social sharing doesn't leak user data until a user goes
to share the page.

## Usage
Insert the following code to get it to run

```html
<div class="socialshare" data-size="{{bubbles/small-bubbles}}"></div>
<script src="socialshare.js"></script>
```

Put your images somewhere cool. Compile the css and include those too.

TODO:

Package everything/minify it put it in the readme how to clone and stuff.
